Intern Task: AI-Powered i18n Translation System
Background
As a global gaming platform, we release games worldwide. To accelerate our production process, we need an automated
system to translate game-related materials into multiple languages. Without this system, translations would have to be
done manually, causing delays in our release cycle.

Objective
Develop a robust internationalization (i18n) translation system using Go. The system should allow users to:

Register and authenticate using JWT.
Upload JSON documents for translation.
Execute translation tasks using an external LLM API.
Monitor translation task statuses.
Download translated documents.
This task assesses the ability to handle persistent storage, integrate external APIs, manage concurrency, and implement
secure and scalable backend solutions.

Endpoints

1. User Authentication
   Deliverables Endpoints:
   POST /auth/users
   POST /auth/login

2. Task Management
   Deliverables Endpoints:
   POST /tasks (Create a Translation Task)
   POST /tasks/{task_id}/translate (Execute Translation Task)
   GET /tasks/{task_id} (Retrieve Task Status Details)
   GET /tasks/{task_id}/download (Download Translated Content)

Middleware
Logging Middleware
[2024-11-21 12:00:00] UserID: 123e4567 - POST /tasks/create - 150ms
Rate Limiting Middleware
Return 429 Too Many Requests when limits are exceeded.

Testing
Provide cURL commands to demonstrate:
User registration and login.
Uploading a document.
Initiating a translation task.
Checking task status.
Downloading the translated document.

Summary of Deliverables
API Implementation:
